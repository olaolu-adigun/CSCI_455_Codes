CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

Initial below to "sign" the above statement:

ADIGUN O.A.
----------------------------------------------
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:

1). For Maze class I created an helper function "recursiveSearch". This 
search method uses this helper function to recursively search for a path
if there is one.

2). For Maze class I created another helper function "adjLocation". This 
recursiveSearch method uses this method to move to the adjacent location
from any location on the maze.

3). For MazeComponent class, I added helper function "drawMaze". This 
function draws the free spaces and walls in the maze.The paintCommponent
uses this function.

4). For MazeComponent class I added helper function "drawMazeComponent". This
function draws the exit and entry locations of the maze. The paint component
uses this function.

5). For MazeComponent class I also added helper function "drawPath". The 
paintComponent uses this function to draw a valid ath if it exists.

6). For drawMaze method I copied the constant values into new parameters 
because I wanted to keep each code statement  on a single line. Using the 
global constant paramters causes some statements  to spill over 2 lines.

7). I added a new helper function "readMazeContent" to MazeViewer class. This
function reads the file with the maze input into a 2D-array. The mazeReadFile 
method uses this function.
