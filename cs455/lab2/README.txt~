1.1)  import java.util.GregorianCalendar;

1.2)  Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar(1995,0,20);

1.3)   System.out.println((calendar.get(Calendar.MONTH)+1) +"/" + calendar.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH) +"/"+ calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR));

1.4)  0

1.5)  calendar.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH,20);


2.1)  "cannot find symbol" - Initially I did not include the import statement for Calendar. I added "import java.util.Calendar" and it corrected the error.

      "  ')' expected   "  - I did not add the closing parenthesis for the println statement. I closed the parenthsis and it rectified the error.


3.1) " ';' expected "       - I did not include the semi-colon at the end of line 24. I rectified it and it worked.
     
     " not a statement"     - I typed "System..out" for printing the output. I removed the second dot and it worked.


3.2)  1/1/1990  - "Your birhtday has already happened this year"
      12/30/1991- "Your birthday has not happened this year"
      6/12/1993 - "Your birthday has not happened this year"
