<h2> CS 455 Lab 9: Enhance <kbd>DataAnalyzer</kbd> program</h2>
</center>

Spring 2016 [Bono]<BR>

<hr>
<h3> Goals and Background </h3>

<p>
This lab involves enhancements to the <kbd>DataAnalyzer</kbd>
example from Ch. 11 of the textbook and discussed in lecture.
<p>
For credit on these exercises, they must be written in the style the
original program is written; for example, it uses exception handling,
and the error-reporting and recovery happens in <kbd>main</kbd>.
<p>

<h3>Reading and reference material</h3> 


<ul>
<li> Ch. 11 of Horstmann text
<li> Section 11.5 of the text presents this example
<li> Exceptions and this example discussed in 10/20 lecture


</ul>


<p>

<H3>Part 1 (1 checkoff pt)</H3>

Copy the java files and data files from <kbd>~csci455/labs/lab9</kbd> to a directory on your own account.  These are:

<ul> 
<li> <kbd><a href="DataAnalyzer.java">DataAnalyzer.java</kbd>
</a>
<li> <kbd><a href="DataSetReader.java">DataSetReader.java</kbd>
</a>
<li> <kbd><a href="BadDataException.java">BadDataException.java</kbd>
</a>
<li> <kbd><a href="in1">in1</a></kbd>, 
<kbd><a href="in2">in2</a></kbd>, 
<kbd><a href="in3">in3</a></kbd>, 
<kbd><a href="in4">in4</a></kbd>, 
<kbd><a href="in5">in5</a></kbd>
</ul>

<p>
This is code for the DataAnalyzer example from the Exceptions chapter of the
textbook (slightly modified from the textbook version), and some
sample input files with and without errors.
<p>
Compile and run the program with the sample data files to see how it
currently behaves.
<p>
Change the program so it still prompts for a new file name if the file
is not found (i.e., it doesn't exit on this error), <strong>but now it will
exit the program if it found problems with the file format.</strong>  It would,
of course, report the error to the user before exiting, as it did
before.

<H3>Part 2 (4 checkoff points total)</H3>

Change the program so it gives more descriptive error messages, and
distinguishes between more errors.  Details given in the following paragraphs.
<p>
  First one that doesn't change: The
following message will be the same as before, and happen in the same
circumstances (except for how Part 1, above, affects the recovery):
<p>
<kbd>Length expected</kbd>
<p>
Instead of the other error messages the current program produces, the
following messages will now be produced when these errors occur

<br>
<em>Note: each one will be worth one point.</em>

<dl>
<dt> <kbd>Bad data: Too many data values given</kbd>
<p>
<dt> <kbd>Bad data: Too few data values given</kbd>
<p>
<dt> <kbd>Bad data: Non-floating point value given: 0-05</kbd>
<dd>Shows an example of the output when the file contained <kbd>0-05</kbd> somewhere instead of a valid floating point number -- i.e., your message should include the invalid input detected.
<p>
<dt> <kbd>File not found: foo</kbd>
<dd>Shows an example of the output when the file name entered was <kbd>foo</kbd>, but that file does not exist -- i.e., your message should include the file name given by the the user.

</dl>
